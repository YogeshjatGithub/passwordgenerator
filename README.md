Password Generator
This Python script generates a random password based on the user's input for the number of letters, numbers, and special characters.

Features
The user specifies the minimum number of:
Letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, etc.)
The program ensures that the password contains at least the specified minimum number of each character type.
The password is randomly shuffled to ensure it's unpredictable.
How it Works
The user is prompted to input:
The minimum number of letters.
The minimum number of numbers.
The minimum number of special characters.
The program generates the required number of characters from predefined lists of letters, numbers, and special characters.
The generated characters are shuffled randomly to ensure no predictable patterns.
Finally, the generated password is displayed to the user.

How to Use
Run the Python script.
Enter the desired minimum number of letters, numbers, and special characters when prompted.
The program will display a randomly generated password based on your input.
